make a scene  (I need you to leave before you make a scene)
take my advice and \<do something\>
I am not gonna make it
Its time
Innocent
Get some rest
transfer grief to hunger
I have no other agenda than that
You deserve a _fresh start_
I would like to express my gratitude
Tensions are high
We have weathered storms before
I had a lot of time to reflect
The real thorn in my side
I don't fit to this ... anymore
